# AlgorithmDesignAndAnalysis_Checkers_AI
Design and Analysis of Algorithms for AI-Based Game Development (C++).

# Algorithm Design and Analysis: Game and AI 
The goal of this project is to develop a **computer game** that integrates **artificial intelligence (AI)** techniques with a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. 
The project is part of the *Game Design and Artificial Intelligence* course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Features  
The game must include:
- **Core mechanics** based on selected game rules.
- **AI-driven strategies**, such as *Minimax* or *A* to enhance decision-making.
- **Configurable parameters**, like board size or difficulty level.

## üìä Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation  
To evaluate the efficiency of implemented AI techniques, the project will include:
- **Analysis of algorithm complexity** for decision-making approaches.
- **Performance comparison** between different search methods.
- **Execution time measurement** for various AI depths and configurations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  
The implementation will utilize:
- **Programming language:** C++
- **Graphical interface:** Custom-designed UI
- **AI algorithms:** Minimax, A*, or other approved strategies

This project provides an opportunity to explore **AI-driven game design**, analyzing algorithm efficiency while creating an engaging user experience. üöÄ
